 * Interface for a Splitter
 * 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * A splitter is a utility that is not directly used in a relationship extraction process
 * but that is very useful for evaluation purposes.
 * 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * It is expected that a class that implements splitter separates a dataset into several
 * folds in order for it to be used on cross-validation
