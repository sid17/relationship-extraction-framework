/**
 * This class is used for our implementation of:

 * 
 * <b>Description</b><br><br>
 * 
 * This class represents the text surrounding a tuple or many tuples. Is used in the generation of <b>Search Patterns</b> using Window Generation or Document Generation respectively. 
 * 
 * For Document Search Pattern Generation, since no restriction in the size of arrays surrounding tuples will be provided, all the text except for the tuple attribute values will be considered
 * in <b>Search Pattern</b> generation. 
 * 
 * <br>
 * For instance, given a span between entities larger than 9, a windows size of 10 and a sentence (from <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/google_youtube.html">Google.com</a>): "When the acquisition is complete, YouTube will retain its distinct brand identity, 
 * strengthening and complementing Google’s own fast-growing video business. 
 * YouTube will continue to be based in San Bruno, CA, and all YouTube employees will remain with the company. With Google’s technology, advertiser relationships and global reach, 
 * YouTube will continue to build on its success as one of the world’s most popular services for video entertainment." 
 * 
 * <br>One of the <b>Tuple Context</b> (Considering the first two occurrences of <b>Google</b> and <b>YouTube</b>):
 * 
 * <br>1. ["When","the","acquisition","is","complete"] COMPANY ["will","retain","its","distinct","brand","identity","strengthening","and","complementing"] BUYER ["'s","own","fast-growing","video","business","YouTube","will","continue","to","be"]
